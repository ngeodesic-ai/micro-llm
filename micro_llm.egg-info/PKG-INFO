# micro-llm

NGF-powered micro-LLMs: lightweight, domain-specific reasoning sidecars.  
This repo is a research testbed: first for **ARC** (visual reasoning), then for a **DeFi** PoC — both built on top of the `ngeodesic` Python package.

---

## Why this repo?

- **ARC micro-LLM (today):** a compact, NGF-style classifier that detects and orders latent “primitives” on synthetic ARC-like traces. It demonstrates the **Adapter → Detect** path and stable metrics.
- **DeFi micro-LLM (next):** same skeleton, different adapter — turn market features into latent traces and reuse the exact parser/denoiser stack.

> NGF’s repeatable pipeline: **Adapter → Warp → Detect → Denoise → Execute → Verify**. Here we focus on Adapter→Detect (+optional Denoise) for a small, reliable sidecar you can pair with a larger LLM.

---

## Foundation: `ngeodesic` (NGF Stage-10/11)

- **Stage-10 (Parser):** matched-filter parsing with dual thresholds (absolute vs null; relative vs best channel), then ordering by peak time.
- **Stage-11 (Denoise):** stabilization via hybrid EMA+median smoothing, confidence gates, seed-jitter averaging — the Warp→Detect→Denoise doctrine to suppress phantoms.

These are provided by the `ngeodesic` package and reused here without modification.

---

## What’s included

- **ARC sandbox**: synthetic adapters that produce per-primitive traces; evaluation scripts that compute accuracy, precision/recall/F1, and NGF-native rates (hallucination/omission).
- **DeFi stubs (WIP)**: adapters for market features → latent traces; same parser/denoiser stack; same metrics.
